# Strategic Compact Skill

Suggests manual `/compact` at strategic points in your workflow rather than relying on arbitrary auto-compaction.

## When to Activate

- Running long sessions that approach context limits (100K+ tokens used)
- Working on multi-phase tasks (research → plan → implement → test)
- Switching between unrelated tasks within the same session
- After completing a major milestone and starting new work
- When responses slow down or become less coherent (context pressure)

## Why Strategic Compaction?

Auto-compaction triggers at arbitrary points:
- Often mid-task, losing important context
- No awareness of logical task boundaries
- Can interrupt complex multi-step operations

Strategic compaction at logical boundaries:
- **After exploration, before execution** — Compact research context, keep implementation plan
- **After completing a milestone** — Fresh start for next phase
- **Before major context shifts** — Clear exploration context before different task

## How It Works

The `suggest-compact.sh` script runs on PreToolUse (Edit/Write) and:

1. **Tracks Edit/Write calls** — Counts Edit and Write tool invocations in session (hook fires on these tools only)
2. **Threshold detection** — Suggests at configurable threshold (default: 50 calls)
3. **Periodic reminders** — Reminds every 25 calls after threshold

## Hook Setup

First, make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x $HOME/.claude/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.sh
```

Then add the following to the `hooks` section in `~/.claude/settings.json` (merge with existing hooks, do not replace):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash \"$HOME/.claude/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.sh\"" }]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash \"$HOME/.claude/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.sh\"" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `COMPACT_THRESHOLD` — Edit/Write calls before first suggestion (default: 50)

## Compaction Decision Guide

Use this table to decide when to compact:

| Phase Transition | Compact? | Why |
|-----------------|----------|-----|
| Research → Planning | Yes | Research context is bulky; plan is the distilled output |
| Planning → Implementation | Yes | Plan is in TodoWrite or a file; free up context for code |
| Implementation → Testing | Maybe | Keep if tests reference recent code; compact if switching focus |
| Debugging → Next feature | Yes | Debug traces pollute context for unrelated work |
| Mid-implementation | No | Losing variable names, file paths, and partial state is costly |
| After a failed approach | Yes | Clear the dead-end reasoning before trying a new approach |

## What Survives Compaction

Understanding what persists helps you compact with confidence:

| Persists | Lost |
|----------|------|
| CLAUDE.md instructions | Intermediate reasoning and analysis |
| TodoWrite task list | File contents you previously read |
| Memory files (`.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`) | Multi-step conversation context |
| Git state (commits, branches) | Tool call history and counts |
| Files on disk | Nuanced user preferences stated verbally |

## Best Practices

1. **Save session before compacting** — Run `/save-session` to persist current context to a file before compacting; resume later with `/resume-session`
2. **Compact after planning** — Once plan is finalized in TodoWrite, compact to start fresh
3. **Compact after debugging** — Clear error-resolution context before continuing
4. **Don't compact mid-implementation** — Preserve context for related changes
5. **Read the suggestion** — The hook tells you *when*, you decide *if*
6. **Use `/compact` with a summary** — Add a custom message: `/compact Focus on implementing auth middleware next`

## Context Composition Awareness

Monitor what's consuming your context window:
- **CLAUDE.md files** — Always loaded, keep lean
- **Loaded skills** — Each skill adds 1-5K tokens
- **Conversation history** — Grows with each exchange
- **Tool results** — File reads, search results add bulk

### Duplicate Instruction Detection

Common sources of duplicate context:
- Same rules in both `~/.claude/rules/` and project `.claude/rules/`
- Skills that repeat CLAUDE.md instructions
- Multiple skills covering overlapping domains
